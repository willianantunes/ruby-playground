# Ruby Playground

I did other playgrounds (see my profile) as this one and in order to learn Ruby nothing like doing the same thing. Let's see how powerful it is!

## What I'm using to learn Ruby

I bought the book [The Well-Grounded Rubyist, Third Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-rubyist-third-edition). So far so good! See the official source-code from it [here](https://github.com/jleo3/twgr).

Usually I read an entire book that teaches about a language to get its basics (control flow, rules, classes, objects, contracts and so on). After that I code an entire production ready project to apply what I learned.

### My review

The book teaches everything you need to know around the language basics, so if you bought with it in mind you'll be well served. It puts you in contact with everything, even threading and discuss some aspects like GVL. My only concerns is related to some thought looking over the market. It could have introduced things like:

- How to play with `gem` and why use `bundler`;
- Convention about how to organize your project. In Java world you have `src/main/java`, how is it related in Ruby?
- Unit tests with UnitTest, MiniTest and Rspec;
- Discussion over famous frameworks, some sort of appendix, I don't know.

I read all the book through [Manning Livebook](https://livebook.manning.com/book/the-well-grounded-rubyist-third-edition/).

Now, if I would have bought the book if I'd known these issues? Of course! That's all I have to say.
