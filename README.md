# Ruby Playground

I did other playgrounds (see my profile) as this one and in order to learn Ruby nothing like doing the same thing. Let's see how powerful it is!

## What I'm using to learn Ruby

I bought the book [The Well-Grounded Rubyist, Third Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-rubyist-third-edition). So far so good! See the official source-code from it [here](https://github.com/jleo3/twgr).

Usually I read an entire book that teaches about a language to get its basics (control flow, rules, classes, objects, contracts and so on). After that I code an entire production ready project to apply what I learned.
