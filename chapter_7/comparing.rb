# If you want objects of class MyClass to have the full suite of
# comparison methods, all you have to do is the following
# 1. Mix a module called Comparable (which comes with Ruby) into MyClass.
# 2. Define a comparison method with the name <=> as an instance method in MyClass.
# The comparison method <=> (usually called the spaceship operator or spaceship method) is the heart of the matter

  # Numbers already know how to compare themselves to each other
