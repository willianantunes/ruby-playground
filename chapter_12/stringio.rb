# What if you want to write a test for the DeCommenter module?
# Testing file transformations can be difficult, because you need to maintain the input file
# as part of the test and also make sure you can write to the output fileâ€”which you then have to read back in.
# StringIO makes it easier by allowing all the code to stay in one place without the need to read or write actual files
