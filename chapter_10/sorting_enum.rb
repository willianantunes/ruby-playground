# Like sort, sort_by is an instance method of Enumerable.
# The main difference is that sort_by always takes a block, and it only requires that you
# show it how to treat one item in the collection

# Our Painting class implemented <=> to achieve sorting within an array.
# But try to compare one painting to another on your own (outside of an array), and youâ€™ll run into trouble:
